# Geodesic-Points

The objective of this project was to develop an interactive web page to view information about national GBVs. The page consists of two parts:

  - A geographic map taking up most of the page and displaying available VGs in your geographic locations. VGs are displayed by different icons, according to their order. The name is shown (using a "tooltip"), when the mouse is positioned over a VG. When clicking on a VG, a balloon opens that displays all known information about that VG, in addition to the possibility of having buttons to execute commands.
  - A dashboard on the left side shows statistics and provides various control widgets.
